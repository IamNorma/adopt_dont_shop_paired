# Adopt Don't Shop Paired Project
Adopt Don't Shop Paired is a paired programming project for Turing School of Software & Design's Back-End Engineering program.

The project is a fictional website where users can see pets that are currently housed in a shelter, see reviews from those shelters, and then favorite and apply for pets which they have favorited. Those applications can also be approved.
